# ES114-Probability-Statistics-Data-Visualization-
This Repository contains the solution codes to assignments that were given in the ES114 course taught during the second semester at IIT Gandhinagar 

The Assignments pertain to the following Questions:

## [Assignment 10]
Questions: <br>
1)A plot of number of competitions/Locations across the world where International level Tennis was played<br>
2)A Dataframe showing the years(2000 - 2024) and the average weight of players who emerged as champions in different tournaments in that year. Plot Line Graph<br>
3)Same as 2 but for length<br>
4)Same as 2 but for losers<br>
5)Same as 3 but for losers<br>
6)Same as 2 but for worldrank<br>
7)Same as 4 but for worldrank<br>
8)Analyze the different birthplaces for winners . go yearwise. so for 2000, make a dictionary storing all winnners and where were they from. At the end, after analyzing for all years, we shall have 25 such dictionaries. Then just add up the count for each specific place. take only first 20 or 30<br>
9)Same as 8 but instead of birthplace, use turned_pro column form atpp<br>
10)Same as 8 but instead of birthplace, use birth_year column from atpp<br>

## [Assignment 9]
Consider the attached dataset
IRIS attached below. Load the dataset using the seaborn library function as per the attached link. There are 150 data points in this dataset and 3 different species.
1. Estimate the covariance matrix of the 4 attributes.

2. Estimate the four principal components of the data.

3. Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA to reduce 150 data points into two dimensions and three dimensions.

4. Visualize the reduced dimension 150 data points in 2D and 3D while giving different colors to reduced data points of diff different species.


## [Assigmnent 8]
Consider the attached dataset
IRIS attached below. Load the dataset using the seaborn library function as per the attached link.
1. Estimate the mean and the variance of the four attributes.

2. Arrange the pairs of attributes in the descending order of their correlation coefficients.

3. Repeat the Question 2 above for the 3 different species separately and report the same.


## [Assignment 7]
a) Write a Python program to determine if a given Joint PMF corresponds to independent random variables (X,Y) or not. Take the range of values of random variables X and Y as the input and then take the Joint PMF as the input. Assume X and Y take finite number of values.

b) Plot the Joint PMF and the corresponding Joint CDF. Also, determine and plot the two Marginal PMFs and Marginal CDFs.

c) Determine the value of E[XY]. If X1=X-E[X] and Y1=Y-E[Y], determine E[X1Y1].


## [Assignment 6]
Implement Otsu's Threshold method for binarizing a given greyscale image with an intensity range of [0,255]. The output binary image should have only two intensity options, 0 and 1/255. Add Gaussian noise to the input greyscale image of varying variance and report the results. Sample implementations are available in the links attached. However, you need to write your code for this method.

Show the final results on the given dataset [https://iitgnacin-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/19210048_iitgn_ac_in/EQGIYSfTWplDiL4l891VnsMB0GAmKOh0lESGiXcBf3etBg?e=IFOkAF]

## [Assignment 5]
The Assignment involved reading images and performing histogram equalization and matching. The goal of this Assignment was to give on image a similiar appearence to another one.

## [Assignment 4] 
1. Plot the Probability Density Functions (PDF) of the following Continuous Random Variables by varying the appropriate parameters taken as user input. Compare the plots of the same PDF plotted with different parameters. 

a) Uniform

b) Gaussian/Normal

c) Exponential

d) Cauchy

e) Laplacian

f) Rayleigh

2. Plot the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of each continuous random variable above by varying parameters values taken as user input if the closed form mathematical expression exists. 

3. Plot the CDF of each discrete random variable given in Lab Assignment 3 by varying parameters values taken as user input (No need to derive closed form expression in this case).



## [Assignemnt 3]
1. Plot the Probability Mass Functions of the following Discrete Random Variables by varying the appropriate parameters taken as input. Compare the plots of the same PMF plotted with different parameters. 

a) Discrete Uniform

b) Bernoulli

c) Binomial

d) Poisson

e) Geometric

2. Show the equivalence of Binomial and Poisson for large values of M and small values of p.
